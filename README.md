# MMAN2700-Compressor-Lab
Used Jupyter notebook to sort through multiple sets of data from a compressor lab demonstration.

Provided valuable experience in using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. Most notably allowed myself
to understand dataframes in python and what can or cannot be done with them. 

The file has been streamlined to provide the necessary functions at the beginning and visualisation
at the end.
